This project generates code to address the following user stories:

User story #1

As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination 
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport and confirm that it has landed 

User story #2

As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination 
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

User story #3

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy 

User story #4

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy 

User story #5

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

User story #6

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
